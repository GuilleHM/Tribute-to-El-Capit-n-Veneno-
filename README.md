# Tribute-to-El-Capitan-Veneno-
This repository contains the code (Jupyter Notebook - Python 3 script) and mask (.png) files needed for creating the target word cloud.

The aim of this publication is to pay a posthumous tribute to Juan Carlos Aragón, "El Capitán Veneno": poet, philosopher and renowned author of chirigotas and comparsas of the Cádiz Carnival. To do this, we program a web crawler that obtains the lyrics of his most famous carnival groups and, from these, we create a WORD CLOUD that shows us which words appear the most among his repertoires.
